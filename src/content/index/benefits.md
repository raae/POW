# Flexible

POW! adapts to you cycle, and your level of interest. You can track on or many factors through tags. These tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you at any given time in your cycle. You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyse how the different factors play out throughout your cycle.

# Private

Under the hood POW! uses the [Blockstack](/blockstack) platform. All data is encrypted before it leaves your device to be stored in your own storage hub. This gives you complete control of you data.
