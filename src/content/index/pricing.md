# Free for now

Please show your support on [Product Hunt](#)!

Blockstack is a fairly new framework. The framework empowers developers like me to create privacy first apps, like POW!, for you. To foster adaptation Blockstack runs a program aptly named [App Mining](#). Participating apps get paid from a monthly pool of money based on its rank. The rank is in part based on popularity and upvotes on [Product Hunt](#).

At a later point there will be a subscription model of some sort. It would be a dream come true to make POW! my main gig.

With love, @raae
