# Information for beta user

Thank you so much for using the app in the beta period.

I changed the underlying technology since the beta, so you
unfortunatly need to sign up again.

It will look like your data is lost, but do not worry. It is
still there in the cloud.

However I need some more time to create a way for you, and
myself, to get the data transferred.

Do not worry, I have several months of data I would
desperatly need to transfer myself.

If you would like to get notified when it is ready send an
email to [support@usepow.app](mailto://support@usepow.app).

For now you can [sign up](/signup) to keep track of the days
ahead.
