# Flexible

POW! adapts to **your cycle**, and **your level** of
interest. You can track as many or as few factors as you
like using tags.

Tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you at
any given time in your cycle.

You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyse
how the different factors play out throughout your cycle.

# Private

POW! is as a **privacy-first** app. You keep complete
control of your data. It is never ever shared with any third
parties.

Under the hood POW! uses the [Blockstack](/blockstack)
platform.

All data is encrypted before being stored locally and before
sending it to your storage personal storage hub.

Please show your support on [Product Hunt](#)!

Blockstack is a fairly new framework. The framework empowers
developers like me to create privacy first apps, like POW!,
for you. To foster adaptation Blockstack runs a program
aptly named [App Mining](#). Participating apps get paid
from a monthly pool of money based on its rank. The rank is
in part based on popularity and upvotes on
[Product Hunt](#).

At a later point there will be a subscription model of some
sort. It would be a dream come true to make POW! my main
gig.
