## Your personal cycle

POW! adapts to **your cycle**, and **your interest level**.
You decide what to track by adding your own tags as you go
along.

The tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you
at any given time in your cycle.

You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyze
how the different tags play out throughout your cycle.

## Your personal data

POW! is a **privacy-first** app. You keep complete control
of your data.

Before storing the data locally and in the cloud it is
encrypted with your private key.

Not even @raae, the woman behind the app, can unlock and
read your data.

Under the hood, POW! uses the [Blockstack](/#blockstack)
platform.

## Who is making it and why

I am [@raae](https://raae.codes), an independent web
developer living in Oslo, Norway.

I have toyed with the idea of making a more straight forward
menstrual cycle tracker app for years.

The level of detail I found in the existing apps made me
less inclined to use them; it also felt creepy, a little
invasive.

It turned out my intuition was right.

In February 2018, the
[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636)
came out with a report that popular health apps, period
trackers among them, were leaking data to Facebook
Analytics.

After that there has been many more articles covering the
level of surveilence these types of apps are doing and the
implications of it.

- [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/period-tracker-apps-facebook-maya-mia-fem):
  It also shared “reminders” within the app to take birth
  control medication with Facebook.
- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/your-period-tracking-app-could-be-sharing-intimate-details-with-all-of-facebook):
  These apps then shared user information with the company
  so it could keep track of how many of its employees were
  trying to get pregnant.

I decided it was time to make it and make it in a way that
even shields me, the developer, from your cycle data.

Instead of promising you I will not be evil, I am making
POW! so I can't be evil.

### Open beta

POW! will officially launch March 8th, 2020.

Until then, I would love for you to join the beta.

The app will change drastically and your data might possibly
be lost along the way.

On the upside, you will be able to influence the direction
of POW! I am all ears :D
