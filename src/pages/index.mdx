# Your personal cycle

POW! adapts to **your cycle**, and **your level** of
interest. You can track as many or as few factors as you
like using tags.

Tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you at
any given time in your cycle.

You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyze
how the different factors play out throughout your cycle.

# Your personal data

POW! is as a **privacy-first** app. You keep complete
control of your data. It is never ever shared with any third
parties.

Under the hood POW! uses the [Blockstack](/#blockstack)
platform.

All data is encrypted before being stored locally and before
sending it to your storage personal storage hub.
