# Your personal cycle

POW! adapts to **your cycle**, and **your level** of
interest. You can track as many or as few factors as you
like using tags.

Tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you at
any given time in your cycle.

You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyze
how the different factors play out throughout your cycle.

# Your personal data

POW! is a **privacy-first** app. You keep complete control
of your data. It is never ever shared with any third
parties.

Under the hood POW! uses the [Blockstack](/#blockstack)
platform.

All data is encrypted before being stored locally and before
sending it to your personal storage hub.

# Open beta

POW! is being developed as we speak. This means everything
is not up to the standard I would like yet, and some key
features are still around the corner. You must also prepare
yourself for sudden user interface changes.

But if you, as I, believe in a menstrual cycle tracker that
lets us be in charge of our cycles, please start using POW!
and hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raae) or
[email](mailto:pow@raae.codes) with your feedback and
suggestions.
