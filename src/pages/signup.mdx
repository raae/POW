# Sign Up

So far, POW! works best if you have a fairly regular cycle.

The algorithm predicting your next menstruation will become
better with time. So check back here in a couple of months,
or sign up for the
[newsletter](https://lillylabs.ck.page/a5f42d2b44) if you
would like to follow the progress.

POW! is also not for those seeking help with conceiving or
those of you who cannot pinpoint the days of your
menstruation as can happen when using hormonal IUDs.

Being on the pill is no problem as that just gives you a
very uniform cycle.

## Plans & Pricing

There are two plans:

- Monthly at USD 4,50 a month.
- and yearly at USD 45,00 a year, saving you two months.

If you for any reason is not happy I will refund your money
within the first 60 days.
