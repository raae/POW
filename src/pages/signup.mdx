# Let's get you started

POW! Uses a framework called
[Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) under the hood.

Therefore you will be asked to create a Blockstack ID when
signing up below. Follow the prompts and you will be back
here in no time.

<SignInButton variant="contained" color="primary">
  Sign Up
</SignInButton>

In a privacy first application like POW! there is no
password recovery. So remember to save the password you
choose somewhere safe.

If you are not using a password manager I (@raae) highly
recomend you start. My personal favorite is
[1Password](https://1password.com/).
