In a privacy first application like POW! there is no
password recovery. If we gave you that possibility we would
also be able to read your data. So remember to save the
password you choose somewhere safe!

If you are not using a password manager I (@raae) highly
recomend you start. My personal favorite is
[1Password](https://1password.com/).
